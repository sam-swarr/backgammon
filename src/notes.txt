Modeling the board:
- 24 points
- each point has number of checkers and what color they are

Settings:
- allow setting direction you move the checkers (counterclockwise or clockwise)
- allow setting your color of checker (both players could have same settings; shouldn't matter)

Moving checkers:
- support one click movement
  - dice are ordered and clicking on a checker moves it the first die amount (unless move is illegal)

- support two click movement
  - clicking on checker highlights possible moves; click again on highlighted point to actually move
