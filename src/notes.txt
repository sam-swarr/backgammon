Settings:
- allow setting direction you move the checkers (counterclockwise or clockwise)
- allow setting your color of checker (both players could have same settings; shouldn't matter)

Moving checkers:
- support one click movement
  - dice are ordered and clicking on a checker moves it the first die amount (unless move is illegal)

- support two click movement
  - clicking on checker highlights possible moves; click again on highlighted point to actually move

Support both local and networked mulitplayer:
  - pure, local Redux store for local mulitplayer
  - Redux store backed by Firebase for online multiplayer
    - redux-thunk allows you to do async calls prior to dispatching to store
      - UI component calls action function -> action function asynchronously
        pushes update to server -> once async function returns, we dispatch to local store


TODO:
  - style dice and undo / submit buttons

  - dice fade as dice are used provisionally

  - add ability to double
    - player's will need to explicitly roll dice rather than them automatically rolling
    - take into account any ties during opening rolls

  - allow players to start new game from game over dialog (maintain current stakes score)

  - online mulitplayer
