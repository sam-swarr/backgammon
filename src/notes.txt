Settings:
- allow setting direction you move the checkers (counterclockwise or clockwise)
- allow setting your color of checker (both players could have same settings; shouldn't matter)

Moving checkers:
- support one click movement
  - dice are ordered and clicking on a checker moves it the first die amount (unless move is illegal)

- support two click movement
  - clicking on checker highlights possible moves; click again on highlighted point to actually move

Support both local and networked mulitplayer:
  - pure, local Redux store for local mulitplayer
  - Redux store backed by Firebase for online multiplayer
    - redux-thunk allows you to do async calls prior to dispatching to store
      - UI component calls action function -> action function asynchronously
        pushes update to server -> once async function returns, we dispatch to local store


TODO:
  - display pieces on the bar / home 
  - add handlers to bar / home to allow movement from / to them
  
  - implement first die roll logic (roll until no tie, set current player appropriately)

  - check for game end state
    - add game state slice (can later add state to track if player has rolled dice or not)

  - dice fade as dice are used provisionally

  - add ability to double
    - player's will need to explicitly roll dice rather than them automatically rolling

  - online mulitplayer

  - add settings menu
